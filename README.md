# 3D_Quote
## 3D Printing Quoting Application

This application is able to give accurate print time, filament usage, etc. values that enable you to accurately quote on a 3D printing job.

The main difference is that this application take the machine variable into account like;
- Acceleration / Deceleration time
- Max travel speed on every axis
- Jerk settings (**Still to be implemented**)
